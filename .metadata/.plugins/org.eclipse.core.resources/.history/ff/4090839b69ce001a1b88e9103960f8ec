 * Feign is a REST service Client makes it easy
 * to call RESTful WebServices
 * 
 * When we use REStTemplate to call other services
 * we have to write lot of duplicate kind of code each
 * time to talk to the RestFul Service in Controller.
 * 
 * By using feign we can define simple Proxy interface 
 * of that Microservice to which we want to talk.
 * 
 *  Simple Feign used to call other Microservices from the
 *  Current MicroService in easy way.
